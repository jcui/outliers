Using Python 2.7.6

**********

Start server:
    bash ./start.sh

Find outliers:
    bash ./outliers.sh [-c <cluster>] [-t <threshold %>]

**********

API:

/v1/clusters/caches/outliers?threshold=<x>
    - List outliers across all clusters for threshold x (default 20)

/v1/clusters/<cluster>/caches/outliers?threshold=<x>
    - List outliers in given cluster for threshold x (default 20)

**********

Code structure:
    flask_app               web service
        \ service           used by web service
            \ caches        info about caches
            \ detection     outlier detection logic

Notes:
1. For each API call, we get details and throughputs for all caches.
    - Details are used to build a mapping of clusters to caches in each cluster.
      Since this may not change often, we could build the mapping once and reuse
      it, refreshing at intervals.
    - We get throughputs for all caches even when finding outliers for a given
      cluster. The cost of processing extra data - given the current data set -
      seems smaller than the cost of making separate requests for each cache's
      throughput.
    - Both these issues could be fixed by having a cluster-level API: one call
      to get details for all caches in a cluster, one call to get the throughputs.
      This would be increasingly useful as more caches are added.
2. We pass unnamed 2- and 3-tuples between modules for simplicity. For larger
   projects or to return more info, we would probably want a better interface and
   create classes.
3. To find outliers, we calculate the average throughput of a cluster, then
   compare the throughput of each cache in the cluster to the average.
    - For more complex metrics, we could try to parallelize the computation,
      either with multiple threads or by distributing it across machines.
4. To persist a given threshold for future requests, we could introduce a
   configuration API, e.g.:
        /v1/clusters/caches/outliers/configuration/
        /v1/clusters/<cluster>/caches/outliers/configuration/
    - The configuration could include other metrics in addition to the threshold.
    - GET returns the current configuration as key-value pairs.
    - POST with a set of key-value pairs updates the configuration.
